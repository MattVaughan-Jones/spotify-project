Spotify Project

This is a simple project to help me learn React and node. I ententionally avoided using some common abstractions like express and axios to force myself to use the features that these are built on top of, and better understand how they work.

This webapp accesses a Spotify user's playlist data, asks them to select which playlist they feel like listening to right now, and psychoanalyses them based on the properties of the songs in the playlist.

Do next:
- suggestion to select a different playlist if empty
- deploy to render
    - remove references to localhost or port 8080 which won't apply to render?
